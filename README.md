# bad-haskell-router

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bwiklund/bad-haskell-server.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bwiklund/bad-haskell-server)

This is a simple http server built on top of haskell from the ground up.

Its only purpose is to force me to get better at haskell. If you use it for any real purpose then you are likely to have a bad time.
